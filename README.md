# etcd-defrag

Giant Swarm offers an etcd-defrag app which is installed in workload clusters by default.

Here, we define the etcd-defrag chart with its templates and default configuration.

## Installation

This app is already installed in your workload cluster by default and therefore not meant to be installed manually.

## Credit

This app is based on the images and manifests provided by @ahrtr in their [etcd-defrag](https://github.com/ahrtr/etcd-defrag) project.
